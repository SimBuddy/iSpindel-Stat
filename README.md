# iSpindel-Thermostat
Control of heaters using iSpindel devices and heaters or standard heat pads.

To make use of this project, you first need an iSpindel, and with it, a cloud account with Brew-spy.  This is free.  
The final device will read the data you already send via your iSpindel, and use the temperature component to decide to
turn a heater on or off.  This could be an equarium-style heater, a heating pad, or a space heater.

There is no need to provide your Brew-SPy account details, as your Brew-Spy account already publishes it, anonymously, but 
accessible nonetheless.
